# Zeina Portfolio

## Description

I built this website as a portfolio to keep track of my coding assignments and have them viewable to potential employers and anyone insterested in
my work.

This project helped me learn a lot about CSS and HTML layout. I learned that CSS is very fidley and you can keep working on it forever.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

You can scroll and find a description about me, links attached to an image (or abstract of the work), title and description of which language was used for the program. If you hover over the image it has a glow and an overlay is removed. If you click on the navigation bar it also takes you to it's corresponding section. If you click on the items in contact me they take you to their relative links. When the screen is minimised to phone size, the layout changes, and the nav and contact me items have a shadow when clicked on.
